Personal data
======================================================================================================
   I'm a postgraduate specialized in Java, C#, Python development on Windows, Linux and Mac platforms. My working experiences are mostly related to web when I was working in HAMASTAR. The most representative project is "Taipei Summer Universiade volunteer registration" website. And now I'm working on data mining, machine learning and deep learning with python in my master's career. I'm researching on Fake News detection now. I am looking forward for opportunities in data analysis, algorithm, and web services. And I expect to start looking for a job by the end of this year (after I graduated from school).
